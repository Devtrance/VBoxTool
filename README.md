VBoxTool
========

A (really) small bash script to perform pretty basic operations with background machines on VirtualBox. Ideal for start and stop virtual servers.

It requires, of course, a VirtualBox installation. It's writted and tested on Elementary OS Luna, but I think it should work on almost every Linux machine (and Mac?).
